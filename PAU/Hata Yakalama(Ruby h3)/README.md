This Ruby code reads input integers until an empty line is entered, calculates the reciprocal of each non-zero integer, and accumulates the sum of these reciprocals. If a zero is entered, it skips that input. The final sum is then printed.

The code includes commented-out lines that demonstrate how to handle the ZeroDivisionError using a begin-rescue block. However, in this case, it seems the code intentionally skips zero values without raising an error.

If you have any specific questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
