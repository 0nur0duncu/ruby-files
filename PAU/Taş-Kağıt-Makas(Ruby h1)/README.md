# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in Ruby

This Ruby program implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Two players input their choices, and the program determines the winner based on the classic rules:

- Rock crushes scissors.
- Scissors cut paper.
- Paper covers rock.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the choice for the first player.
3. Enter the choice for the second player.
4. The program will announce the winner or declare a tie.

### Example

```ruby
# Input
Enter the choice for the first player (rock, paper, or scissors): rock
Enter the choice for the second player (rock, paper, or scissors): scissors

# Output
birinci oyuncu kazandÄ±
```

## Notes

- The program checks for a tie first and then evaluates the rules to determine the winner.
- The choices are case-sensitive, and invalid inputs are not handled in this example.

This example demonstrates a basic implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Ruby. Feel free to expand and enhance the program based on your preferences and requirements.
